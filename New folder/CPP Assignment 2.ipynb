    "Hope you enjoyed the first assignment! This is the jupyter notebook for the second assingnment. In this notebook, we will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initialise a system\n",
    "2) Visualise the system \n",
    "3) Develop a spin flip algorithm and see how the system converges to the ground state \n",
    "4) Perform binning analysis for the single spin flip algorithm and evaluate the autocorrelation time \n",
    "5) Apply the Swendsen-Wang or Wolff algorithm for cluster flipping \n",
    "6) Perform binning analysis and evaluate the autocorrelation time for Swendsen-Wang/Wolff \n",
    "7) Compare single spin flip and Swendsen-Wang/Wolff\n",
    "8) Find magnetisation as a function of temperature\n",
    "9) Evaluate the standard error \n",
    "10) Find the autocorrelation time as a function of temperature \n",
    "11) Based on all of the above, find the critical temperature of the 2D Ising model \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a lot, I will provide a good chunk of hints to make the process smoother. As previously stated, you will benefit more if you abstain from using LLMs here. At best it will only be useful to debug any cython errors.\n",
